# Microsoft Teams Call Record Insights

## What is Call Record Insights?

Call Record Insights is a turnkey application template for retrieving, parsing, flattening, and storing Microsoft Teams Call Records retrieved via Graph API.

This application enables you to retrieve your tenant's call records, parse them into a meaningful format and store them in Cosmos DB and Kusto without writing any code yourself.

Because this solution uses Cosmos DB it is highly scalable and because it uses Kusto it is very friendly to application development and deep data analysis.

The solution is fully deployed within your own tenant. All data processing and data storage is done in whichever tenant you deploy the application.
